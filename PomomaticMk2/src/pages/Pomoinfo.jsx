<p>I'm glad you asked.</p>
<p>Developed by Francisco Cirilla in the 1980s, a Pomodoro is a time-management technique</p> 
<p>that breaks up a task or multiple tasks into 25-minutes chunks, spaced with five-minute breaks in-between</p>
 
<h1 id = "pomoh">How do I use the Pomomatic?</h1>
<p>It's simple. First you fill out the pomolist, giving a brief description of each task</p>
<p>Then you set the timer</p>
<p>Then you save</p>
<p>Repeat until you have four pomodoros</p>
<p>Get to work!</p>
<h1 id = "pomoh">What's with the Tomato?</h1>
<p>When developing the technique, Francisco used a kitchen timer shaped like a tomato. The italian word for tomato is "Pomodoro". Hence the name and the tomato icon</p>
